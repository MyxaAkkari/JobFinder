# Project Job Finder

Experimental site for employers to find new workers and for people to find new jobs available.

# Know Bugs (so far):

im unable to get the css fully working on the Job form page, i used some css attributs in the html file of the job form.
the job list is local and not saved on any data base, need to find why php didn't work for me
the website wont take the CV and send the info to the employer because i didn't get the php to work
so to work around it i made the site open the mail client on the client side with the collected info from the apply form and the email from the picked job listing to send it manually to the employer
